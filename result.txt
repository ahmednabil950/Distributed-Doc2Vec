TARGET 6207   <<maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun  check isolated location with valuable object which is 
begging to be stolen  check tasty looking love interest  check assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy european 
accents  check german sounding bad guy played by an english actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion  check corny one liners 
 check br br deary me does this film take the wee wee or what the clichés come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just 
stand around gawping at just how bad the script is br br in a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of die hard only set on a
mountain complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid we have all the usual action move cliché s ticked off progressively as we go along
with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off br br jack wild is 
the cop in full on john mcclane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point 
br br in amidst this mess there are a few well known recognisable faces who i can only assume needed the cash and or were simply playing it 
for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion 
complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects br br looking up this three quid from the supermarket bargain bin effort on imdb i am 
astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels i have got to find these gems on dvd it looks like the first sequel is a 
rip off of under siege 2 and the second sequel well goodness knows one thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing jack changes 
with each film and even the character s name seems to change for the third instalment br br still blind purchases of cheap dvd s just would not
be the same if studios didn t keep trotting out material of this awful quality>>

SIMILAR | DISSIMILAR MOST (3884, 0.8916677236557007):  <<terry west had a good idea w this movie he just didn t flesh it thru there are 
endless shots of the creepy looking school s exteriors that go on forever and probably to pad the film s running time also at this school 
there are only 2 students misty mundae is good as usual but this film will always belong to ruby larocca which is the only reason to watch
the film in the beginning if the script centered on her interesting character we d have a movie to watch she is so gorgeous good news for 
dvd buyers terry west s earlier and better film blood for the muse is a special feature one thing i d like to say is that this movie feels 
like someone who s not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the ending feels that very same way then again just 
watch this for ruby larocca>>

MEDIAN (2230, 0.6513432264328003):  <<br br however the ladies of all ages will lap it up no doubt at least the opposite sex understand 
what it is to be a mother and most of us men try to fathom out what it is to be a father whether changing nappies is not at all my favourite 
occupation and trying to get those bottled baby foodstuffs into errant toothless mouths must rank very high on household duties preferably left 
to its mother has absolutely nothing to do with the matter br br some good interpretations here and a good story idea the handling of the matter 
limited to rather scanty tv production concepts gives the film a rather over mellowy taste with not much new to offer an insipid way of delivering 
the goods and in the end the outcome is so forseeable during the last 20 minutes or so even my wife dozed off and i was jumping up to the computer 
to get the on line scoring in the barcelona deportivo match hoping the away team would do something rather good they did this film did not br br 
better by far is mike leigh s magnificent secrets and lies qv which touches on the same subject matter but with brenda blethyn playing a far 
superior part>>

LEAST (9075, 0.08773612231016159):  <<this movie is about a female rape victim comic book writer from new york that decides to get away from all 
that awful big city glamor and move to a dirty run down small town where she finds refuge in a single wide trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of 
12th and nowhere the townspeople are mentally ill yet so is she for inviting crazy men into her trailer annoying is the fact that she has the ability 
to do exactly the right thing to place herself in dangerous circumstance after dangerous circumstance db sweeney s performance was high school at best 
he s one of those kinda cute young actors with a sweet grin unfortunately career has not been kind and mother nature has been right in tow to the 
previous commentator stating that the acting was so real well i agree actually it wasn t acting the two main characters really are pathetic weak and 
incapable of making mature healthy decisions in brief this movie sucks like no other rent it to laugh at it the real crime scene the atrocious 
wood paneling in the trailer enough to make me commit murder and lastly she s a artist writer so couldn t she afford a double wide trailer and 
something other than a sun yellow chevy chevette for love of god>>
