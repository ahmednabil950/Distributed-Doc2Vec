ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie or any taiwanese movie propably for a reason this one was a really boring one even though it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels br br having read other peoples thoughts i was looking forward for some violence and gore but there s not much at all some blood puking and other lame stuff if you are waiting for graphic gore or any gruesome effects you will be disappointed they clearly didn t use the eel exploding and other things to their maximum potent br br pretty much nothing good about this movie a single character that wasn t completely bland and a few ok black magic spells like the eel one the plot was confusing and boring the characters were thin and annoying including the main character the horror aspect didn t work at all the most horrifying thing was an albino girl not that scary really this is the worst asian horror movie i have ever seen
