warped take on the pinocchio theme and set during the christmas season after the previous entry abandoned ties to christmas has booby trapped toys sent to murder a child yet through this other victims are accidentally harmed in the process perhaps by a toy maker s son screaming mad george was responsible for the killer toys including a larvae which enters a victim s mouth and out his eye another where soldier toys actually shoot real bullets at a babysitter after her boyfriend was practically strangled by a severed hand toy operating from a remote control the little target is a mute child named derek william thorne whose stepdad was murdered by a red ball with extending arms that ensnare his face causing him to land on a fireplace poker mother sarah jane higginson worries about her son s mental state figuring his reluctance towards opening presents or more importantly talking derives from watching her husband s horrific murder derek s real father noah tracy fraim fears for his son t safety and informs reluctantly his ex girlfriend sarah that the local toymaker joe petto mickey rooney once was arrested for setting traps in toys to harm kids due to the loss of an unborn child when his wife was killed in a car crash kind of a retaliation in saying that if he couldn t have a son then others shouldn t either still quite a heavy drinker often seen swigging jack petto seems to have set aside his feelings towards kids but his creepy son pino brian bremer hasn t and derek he harbors angst towards why you ll soon understand br br pretty disappointing special effects and rather goofy premise rooney s name adds an allure to the film gaining it a notoriety but his histrionics can only help so much attractive lead actress higginson slaughterhouse and fraim as the man who re enters her life aren t so bad but the lame plot that develops is hard to take seriously i m guessing that s the point but rooney has no reason to be in such a film as this he has no room to bring any personality to his toymaker other than rage and desperation quite volatile barely holding himself together as he explodes in anger towards pino when not downing liquor bremer is appropriately weird and robotic as pino longing to have sarah as his mama the practical effects used during the attacks on victims are rather unconvincing screaming mad george s work with savage steve holland was far more effective than what we see in this film the sex everyone talks about isn t as gratuitous as many would have you believe i can t even recall any nudity probably the best of the numerous sequels greenlighted but that s not exactly an endorsement i m pretty sure written on paper this was an entertaining concept the idea of spoofing pinocchio using horror elements but the result doesn t exactly blow you away
